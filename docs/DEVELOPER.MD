### New Developer Documentation (docs/developer.md)


# BlueFire-Nexus Developer Documentation

This document provides detailed insights into the project architecture, module interactions, logging, error handling, and security compliance features.

## Architecture Overview

BlueFire-Nexus is divided into several core components:

- **Core Modules (src/core):**
  - **polymorphic_engine.py:** Implements payload mutation with cryptographically secure randomness and junk code insertion.
  - **anti_sandbox.py:** Contains functions to detect sandbox environments using Windows API calls and process enumeration.
  - **dynamic_api.py:** Resolves API calls dynamically to bypass static analysis.

- **Modules (src/modules):**
  - **ai_analysis.py:** Builds and loads an LSTM-based model to simulate legitimate network traffic profiles.
  - **evasion_techniques.py:** Provides additional obfuscation strategies including timestamp spoofing and anti-forensic measures.
  - **legal_safeguards.py:** Enforces safety protocols (kill-switch, environment checks) to ensure legal and safe testing.
  - **forensic_logger.py:** Implements detailed logging and emergency self-destruct routines.

- **Operators (src/operators):**
  - **payload_injection.py:** Contains code for payload injection and process hollowing.
  - **c2_protocols:** Includes modules for DNS tunneling and TLS fast-flux methods.

## Logging & Error Handling Enhancements

- **Granular Logging:**  
  The `forensic_logger.py` module has been enhanced to log critical events with timestamps and severity levels. Developers should add similar logging in other modules for better traceability.

- **Robust Error Handling:**  
  Each module is expected to catch and log exceptions. For example, in `dynamic_api.py`, unresolved API calls now trigger a detailed log message before raising an error.

## Security & Compliance

- **Configuration Hardening:**  
  The configuration file (`config.yaml`) includes mandatory safety parameters (e.g., auto-wipe, runtime limits). Developers must ensure these settings are enforced in code.

- **User-Friendly Configuration:**  
  Inline comments in the sample configuration file provide guidance on acceptable values and usage scenarios.

## Code Readability & Modularization

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  Each module is focused on a specific functionality. This separation makes it easier to update or replace parts of the system without affecting the whole platform.
  
- **Inline Documentation:**  
  All functions and classes include docstrings that explain their purpose, parameters, and expected behavior. We recommend maintaining high documentation standards for any new code.

## Testing 

- **Test Coverage:**  
  - Unit tests in `tests/unit_tests.py` validate core functionalities.
  - Integration tests in `tests/integration_tests.py` simulate full lab scenarios.
