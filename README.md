# BlueFire-Nexus

A comprehensive Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) simulation platform designed for security testing, red team operations, and threat hunting within controlled environments.

## Overview

BlueFire-Nexus provides a framework for simulating various APT techniques and tactics, primarily based on the MITRE ATT&CKÂ® framework. It allows security professionals to test detection capabilities, validate security controls, and understand complex attack chains in a safe and isolated lab setting.

**Disclaimer:** This tool is intended for **educational and authorized security testing purposes only** in isolated environments. Unauthorized use or deployment against systems without explicit permission is strictly prohibited. Always adhere to the [Ethical Use Policy](legal/ethical_guidelines.md).

## Features

BlueFire-Nexus is built around a modular architecture, simulating various stages of an APT lifecycle:

*   **Execution:** Manages the execution of commands and payloads.
*   **Command & Control (C2):** Simulates C2 communication channels (e.g., DNS, HTTP) for implant control. (Configuration in `config.yaml` under `modules.command_control.c2_channels`)
*   **Persistence:** Implements techniques to maintain access to compromised systems.
*   **Defense Evasion:** Includes techniques to bypass security controls (e.g., Process Hollowing, Argument Spoofing, Parent PID Spoofing).
*   **Exfiltration:** Simulates methods for extracting data from target environments.
*   **Initial Access:** Models techniques for gaining an initial foothold (e.g., phishing placeholders).
*   **Anti-Detection:** Focuses on techniques to avoid detection by security tools (e.g., Sandbox Evasion, Memory Evasion). (See `src/core/anti_sandbox.py`, `src/core/evasion/anti_detection.py`)
*   **Discovery:** Simulates methods for reconnaissance within a network (e.g., Network/Service Scanning).
*   **Intelligence:** Handles gathering and simulation related to APT group TTPs and threat intelligence.
*   **Network Obfuscator:** Implements techniques for obscuring network traffic patterns.
*   **Resource Development:** Simulates the acquisition and setup of attack infrastructure and capabilities.
*   **Reconnaissance:** Models active and passive information gathering techniques.

*(Note: The implementation depth of each module may vary. Refer to the code in `src/core/` for details.)*

### Security Features

- Modular design based on APT tactics.
- Configuration-driven execution (`config.yaml`).
- Safety mechanisms (configurable in `config.yaml` under `general.safeties`, e.g., `max_runtime`, `allowed_subnets`).
- Placeholder integrations for telemetry (Splunk, Elastic - see `config.yaml` under `telemetry`).

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url> BlueFire-Nexus
# Example: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BlueFire-Nexus.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd BlueFire-Nexus

# Create a Python virtual environment (Recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Optional: Install dev dependencies
# pip install -r requirements-dev.txt 
```

## Configuration

The main configuration file used by the application is `config.yaml` located in the project root.

1.  **Review/Create `config.yaml`**: If `config.yaml` doesn't exist, a default one might be created on first run (depending on core logic). It's recommended to create it manually based on your needs.
2.  **Use Example as Template**: A detailed template outlining available options and the expected structure (`general`, `modules`, `telemetry`) can be found at `config/config.example.yaml`. You can use this as a reference when creating or modifying your root `config.yaml`.
3.  **Customize `config.yaml`**: Edit the root `config.yaml` file to define your desired simulation parameters, safety settings, module configurations, and telemetry endpoints.

    ```yaml
    # Example structure for ./config.yaml
    general:
      name: "MySimulation"
      mode: "simulation"
      log_level: "INFO" 
      safeties:
        auto_wipe: false # Be careful with auto_wipe!
        max_runtime: 7200 # 2 hours
        allowed_subnets: 
          - "192.168.56.0/24" # Example isolated lab network

    modules:
      # Enable/disable or configure specific modules
      command_control: 
        enabled: true
        c2_channels:
          - protocol: dns
            domain: "apt.internal.lab"
            encryption_key: "{{ env ENCRYPT_KEY }}" # Use env var for secrets

      defense_evasion:
        enabled: true
        # Add specific technique configs if needed

    telemetry: 
      enabled: true
      splunk:
        host: "https://splunk.internal.lab:8088"
        token: "{{ env SPLUNK_TOKEN }}"
      # elastic: ... 
    ```
4.  **Environment Variables**: Note that sensitive values like API keys or encryption keys should be sourced from environment variables (e.g., `{{ env SPLUNK_TOKEN }}`) using a `.env` file or system environment variables. Load dotenv is used (`src/core/config.py`). Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```dotenv
    # .env file
    ENCRYPT_KEY=your_secret_encryption_key_here
    SPLUNK_TOKEN=your_splunk_hec_token_here
    # BLUEFIRE_KILLSWITCH=http://your_killswitch_url (Optional)
    # LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG (Optional, overrides config file)
    ```

## Usage

The primary way to run simulations is via the command-line script:

```bash
# Example: Run the persistence scenario
./scripts/bluefire.sh --profile establish_persistence 

# Example: Run with AI features enabled and DNS exfiltration (if supported)
./scripts/bluefire.sh --profile intel_gathering --ai --exfil dns 
```

This script acts as a wrapper around `src/run_scenario.py`, which likely parses the profile and other arguments to orchestrate the simulation using the `BlueFireNexus` core class.

### Programmatic Usage (Advanced)

It's also possible to import and use the `BlueFireNexus` class directly in Python scripts for more complex integrations or custom scenarios:

```python
from src.core.bluefire_nexus import BlueFireNexus
from src.core.config import config # Access the global config manager

# Ensure config is loaded (BlueFireNexus constructor handles this)
nexus = BlueFireNexus() 

# Access configuration
# c2_config = config.get('modules.command_control', {})

# Execute operations directly (structure depends on module implementation)
# Note: The exact format for 'operation_data' depends on the target module.
try:
    result = nexus.execute_operation("discovery", {
        "scan_type": "network_scan", 
        "targets": ["192.168.56.1/24"]
        # Add other necessary parameters for the discovery module...
    })
    print(f"Discovery Result: {result}")

    result_evasion = nexus.execute_operation("defense_evasion", {
         "technique": "pid_spoofing", 
         "target_command": "powershell.exe -Command ..." 
         # Add other necessary parameters...
    })
    print(f"Evasion Result: {result_evasion}")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```

Refer to the `execute_operation` method in `src/core/bluefire_nexus.py` and the implementations within specific modules (e.g., `src/core/discovery/discovery.py`) for details on required parameters.

## Architecture

The platform is structured as follows:

1.  **Entry Point**: `scripts/bluefire.sh` parses command-line arguments and invokes `src/run_scenario.py`.
2.  **Scenario Runner**: `src/run_scenario.py` likely interprets the profile/arguments and orchestrates the simulation sequence.
3.  **Core Orchestrator**: `src/core/bluefire_nexus.py` contains the `BlueFireNexus` class which initializes and manages all the individual modules. It loads configuration via `ConfigManager` and provides the `execute_operation` method.
4.  **Configuration Manager**: `src/core/config.py` (`ConfigManager` class) handles loading `./config.yaml` and environment variables (`.env`).
5.  **Core Modules**: Located under `src/core/<module_type>/`. Each module (e.g., `CommandControl`, `DefenseEvasion`) encapsulates logic related to a specific APT tactic or function.
6.  **Supporting Code**: Utilities, security functions, loggers potentially reside within `src/core/` or other subdirectories.
7.  **Archived Code**: Unused, experimental, or outdated components are moved to the `archive/` directory for reference.
8.  **Tools**: Separate utilities (like the AI trainer) are in the `tools/` directory.

## Security Considerations

- **Restricted Environment**: **CRITICAL:** Only run BlueFire-Nexus in fully isolated, non-production lab environments where you have explicit authorization.
- **Configuration Safeties**: Carefully configure `general.safeties` in `config.yaml` (e.g., `allowed_subnets`, `max_runtime`) to limit potential impact.
- **Ethical Use**: Strictly adhere to the [Ethical Use Policy](legal/ethical_guidelines.md).
- **Monitoring**: Monitor the simulation environment closely. Utilize the telemetry integrations if configured.
- **Dependencies**: Review dependencies for security vulnerabilities.
