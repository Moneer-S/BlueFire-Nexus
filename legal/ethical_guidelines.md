# Ethical Use Policy

## Core Principles  
1. **Authorization**: Obtain explicit, written permission from the target asset owner before conducting any operations.
2. **Containment**: Strictly confine all activities to pre-approved, isolated lab or testing environments. Never target production systems or networks.
3. **Transparency**: Document all planned operations, configurations used, actions taken, and observed outcomes.
4. **Minimization**: Use the minimum level of access and intrusiveness necessary to achieve authorized testing objectives. Avoid unnecessary data collection or system disruption.

## Authorized Use Cases  
- Security control validation within designated test environments by authorized personnel (e.g., red teams, security researchers).
- Vulnerability research in isolated, non-production networks.
- Academic study of attack and defense methodologies in controlled settings.

## Prohibited Actions  
❌ Any activity without prior, explicit, written authorization.
❌ Deployment or operation targeting production systems, networks, or third-party assets.
❌ Attempting to bypass or disable safety mechanisms configured for the test environment.
❌ Collection, exfiltration, or storage of real sensitive data, credentials, or Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

## Data Handling (in Test Environments)  
- Utilize synthetic or anonymized data for testing whenever possible.
- Configure and follow data retention policies appropriate for the test engagement (e.g., automated purging of logs and collected artifacts).

## Compliance Monitoring (Example Controls) 
- Regular review or audit of testing activities and logs.
- Implementation and verification of technical safety controls (e.g., network segmentation, kill-switch mechanisms if applicable).
- Clear reporting channels for any deviations from authorized scope or potential incidents.

## Incident Response (Example Steps)
- Immediately halt unauthorized or unintended activity.
- Activate any available kill-switch or containment mechanisms.
- Follow the pre-defined incident reporting procedure for the test engagement.
- Isolate affected test systems if necessary.
- Execute environment cleanup or reset procedures as planned.
