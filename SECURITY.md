## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of BlueFire-Nexus seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

**Please consider reporting security vulnerabilities privately if possible.** You can do this through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature if enabled for this repository. Alternatively, create a standard GitHub Issue, but **avoid including sensitive details** that could be exploited before a fix is available. Clearly title the issue to indicate its security-sensitive nature.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) in your report to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Security Best Practices

When using BlueFire-Nexus, please follow these security best practices:

1. **Authorization**
   - Only use the platform in authorized testing environments
   - Obtain proper permissions before conducting any security tests
   - Document all testing activities and obtain necessary approvals

2. **Access Control** (For the environment where BlueFire-Nexus is run)
   - Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the host system
   - Use appropriate user permissions
   - Monitor and log access attempts to the system

3. **Configuration**
   - Use secure configuration settings (refer to `config.example.yaml`)
   - Enable encryption options where applicable
   - Implement proper logging and monitoring
   - Regularly review configurations

4. **Network Security** (For the environment where BlueFire-Nexus is run)
   - Use secure protocols (HTTPS, SSH, etc.) for related infrastructure if applicable
   - Implement proper network segmentation if running in a complex environment
   - Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity

5. **Data Protection**
   - Securely handle any sensitive data generated or used during simulations
   - Encrypt sensitive data if stored
   - Implement proper data cleanup procedures after testing

6. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Enable comprehensive logging via the configuration
   - Monitor system activities where the tool is running
   - Regularly review logs for anomalies

7. **Updates and Maintenance**
   - Keep the platform updated by pulling the latest changes from the repository
   - Keep dependencies updated (`pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`)
   - Regularly review the changelog for security updates

8. **Incident Response** (For your testing environment)
   - Have a documented incident response plan for issues arising during simulations
   - Document and analyze any security incidents that occur during testing
   - Implement improvements based on lessons learned

## Security Features

BlueFire-Nexus includes several security features:

1. **Encryption**
   - Configurable encryption options for various modules (e.g., AES-256-GCM)
   - Support for secure communication protocols in relevant handlers

2. **Stealth**
   - Configurable stealth levels
   - Anti-detection and anti-forensics techniques implemented in various modules

3. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - Detailed logging of operations
   - Configurable log levels and outputs
   - Monitoring integration points (e.g., Prometheus planned)

## Security Updates

Security updates will be provided through commits to the main repository branch and documented in the `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Security Testing

We encourage security testing of BlueFire-Nexus:

1. **Community Testing**
   - Users are encouraged to perform code reviews and vulnerability testing.
   - Please report findings responsibly as outlined above.

2. **Internal Testing**
   - Ongoing development includes considerations for secure coding practices.
   - Automated checks (linting, type checking) are part of the development process.

## Security Documentation

Security information can be found in:

* This `SECURITY.md` file
* The main `README.md`
* Configuration examples (`config/config.example.yaml`)
* Module-specific documentation (planned/within code)

## Contact

For security-related inquiries or discussions that are not suitable for public GitHub Issues, please contact the project maintainers through available GitHub communication channels (e.g., mentioning them in a relevant discussion or issue if appropriate, or via profile contact information if provided by the maintainer).

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank all security researchers who contribute to making BlueFire-Nexus more secure through responsible disclosure.
